An app to search the Yelp API for businesses in a given city. Live version is hosted [here](http://ravenouswithyelp.surge.sh/)

## Future work
I will continue to iterate on the project to add the following functionality
- Feedback to the user to show that businesses are being retrieved (a loader)
- Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
- Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
- Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again
- Implement custom sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
- Allow search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”), as opposed to manually clicking
- Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input
